## Introduction

Appium is an open-source mobile automation framework that allows you to automate testing of mobile applications across different platforms (Android, iOS, and Windows). This repository provides a practical example of using Appium for automating interactions with an Android application.

The automation script demonstrates:
- Launching the Android application using Appium
- Interacting with UI elements such as EditText (username and password fields) and TextView (login button)
- Using dynamic data (date formatting) as input (password attempts)
- Handling common challenges like StaleElementReferenceException
- Integrating with a continuous integration (CI) pipeline for automated testing

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before running the automation scripts, ensure you have the following installed:
- Python (3.x recommended)
- Appium Server
- Android SDK tools
- Appium Python client (`appium-python-client`)

### Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/appium-mobile-automation.git
   cd appium-mobile-automation
